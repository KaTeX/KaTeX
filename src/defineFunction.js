/* This file contains a list of functions that we parse, identified by
 * the calls to defineFunction.
 *
 * The first argument to defineFunction is a single name or a list of names.
 * All functions named in such a list will share a single implementation.
 *
 * Each declared function can have associated properties, which
 * include the following:
 *
 *  - numArgs: The number of arguments the function takes.
 *             If this is the only property, it can be passed as a number
 *             instead of an element of a properties object.
 *  - argTypes: (optional) An array corresponding to each argument of the
 *              function, giving the type of argument that should be parsed. Its
 *              length should be equal to `numArgs + numOptionalArgs`. Valid
 *              types:
 *               - "size": A size-like thing, such as "1em" or "5ex"
 *               - "color": An html color, like "#abc" or "blue"
 *               - "original": The same type as the environment that the
 *                             function being parsed is in (e.g. used for the
 *                             bodies of functions like \textcolor where the
 *                             first argument is special and the second
 *                             argument is parsed normally)
 *              Other possible types (probably shouldn't be used)
 *               - "text": Text-like (e.g. \text)
 *               - "math": Normal math
 *              If undefined, this will be treated as an appropriate length
 *              array of "original" strings
 *  - greediness: (optional) The greediness of the function to use ungrouped
 *                arguments.
 *
 *                E.g. if you have an expression
 *                  \sqrt \frac 1 2
 *                since \frac has greediness=2 vs \sqrt's greediness=1, \frac
 *                will use the two arguments '1' and '2' as its two arguments,
 *                then that whole function will be used as the argument to
 *                \sqrt. On the other hand, the expressions
 *                  \frac \frac 1 2 3
 *                and
 *                  \frac \sqrt 1 2
 *                will fail because \frac and \frac have equal greediness
 *                and \sqrt has a lower greediness than \frac respectively. To
 *                make these parse, we would have to change them to:
 *                  \frac {\frac 1 2} 3
 *                and
 *                  \frac {\sqrt 1} 2
 *
 *                The default value is `1`
 *  - allowedInText: (optional) Whether or not the function is allowed inside
 *                   text mode (default false)
 *  - numOptionalArgs: (optional) The number of optional arguments the function
 *                     should parse. If the optional arguments aren't found,
 *                     `null` will be passed to the handler in their place.
 *                     (default 0)
 *  - infix: (optional) Must be true if the function is an infix operator.
 *
 * The last argument is that implementation, the handler for the function(s).
 * It is called to handle these functions and their arguments.
 * It receives two arguments:
 *  - context contains information and references provided by the parser
 *  - args is an array of arguments obtained from TeX input
 * The context contains the following properties:
 *  - funcName: the text (i.e. name) of the function, including \
 *  - parser: the parser object
 *  - lexer: the lexer object
 *  - positions: the positions in the overall string of the function
 *               and the arguments.
 * The latter three should only be used to produce error messages.
 *
 * The function should return an object with the following keys:
 *  - type: The type of element that this is. This is then used in
 *          buildHTML/buildMathML to determine which function
 *          should be called to build this node into a DOM node
 * Any other data can be added to the object, which will be passed
 * in to the function in buildHTML/buildMathML as `group.value`.
