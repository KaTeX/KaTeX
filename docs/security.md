Any HTML generated by KaTeX *should* be safe from `<script>` or other code
injection attacks.
(See `maxSize` below for preventing large width/height visual affronts,
see `maxExpand` below for preventing infinite macro loop attacks, and
see `allowedProtocols` below for preventing certain protocols in `\href`)

Of course, it is always a good idea to sanitize the HTML, though you will need
a rather generous whitelist (including some of SVG and MathML) to support
all of KaTeX.
