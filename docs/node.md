# or globally
npm install -g katex
```

### Yarn

### Building from Source
To build you will need Git, Node.js 6.9 or later, and Yarn.

Clone a copy of the GitHub source repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX.git
cd KaTeX
```

Then install dependencies and run `build` script:
```bash
yarn
yarn build
```

If you'd like to use the built KaTeX in other projects, install the package by
specifying the path:
```bash
yarn add /path/to/KaTeX
# or using npm
npm install /path/to/KaTeX
```

> You can manually download the package and source code from
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/releases).

## Importing
KaTeX is exported as a CommonJS module, which can be imported using `require`:
```js
const katex = require('katex');
```

If you're using a module loader, transpiler, or bundler that supports interoperability
between ECMAScript module and CommonJS module, you can use `import`:
```js
import katex from 'katex';
```

KaTeX also provides an ECMAScript module:
```js
import katex from 'katex/dist/katex.mjs'
```

> The ES module contains ES6 syntaxes and features, and may need transpiling to
use in old environments:
