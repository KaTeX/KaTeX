KaTeX installed [using Node.js package managers](node.md) comes with a built-in CLI
which can be used to render TeX to HTML from the command line. By default, CLI will
take the input from `stdin`.

```bash
npx katex
```

> Above uses the `npx` command to run the locally installed executable.
You can execute with the relative path: `./node_modules/.bin/katex`

> To use CLI from local clone, you need to build the project first by
running `npm run build`
