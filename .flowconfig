# $FlowFixMe
# This suppression hould be used to suppress an issue that requires additional
# effort to be resolved. That effort should be recorded in our issue tracking
# system for follow-up. Usually, this suppression is added by tooling during
# flow upgrades and should not be used directly by developers. If it is
# necessary, make sure to raise the corresponding issue and add the issue
# number to a TODO comment associated with the suppression.

# $FlowIgnore
# Every now and then, flow cannot understand our code the way we can. We just
# know better and we have to tell flow to trust us. Since this isn't something
# we expect to "fix", we can annotate them to just have flow ignore them.
# Using this suppression makes it clear that we know there's an error but it's
# ok to ignore it. Make sure the suppression has associated commentary to state
# why it's okay to ignore the flow error.
